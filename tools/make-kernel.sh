# list" for names this kernel does not have (DriverKit's IOService methods, Apple silicon's _t8110dart_*):
# the machine configuration for an Android phone leaves those parts out. Nothing here loads a kext. But
# an exit status that is always 2 says nothing, and ignoring it would let a real compile or link error

# target that fails (a compile, a link) fails the build. Then the kernel file must exist.
